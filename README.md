In industrial and domestic applications attendance registering is important at each and every moment. Many industries face a lot of problems due to the lack of a proper attendance monitoring system. To overcome this, we must need a tamper-proof, unattended and fast attendance registering system. And the best way for it is to use a biometrics identification system.

Among the various biometric identification systems, Fingerprint identification is one of the most well-known and commonly used ones. It is fast, reliable and tamper-proof. Because of their uniqueness & consistency over time, fingerprints have been used for identification for many years, more recently becoming automated due to advancements in computing capabilities. SO, we are going to use the very same technique for registering and maintaining the attendance record
